in this paper	Written	88	9	4	132	62	0.7
the purpose of this	Written	89	4	2	28	13	0.7
less likely to	Written	90	11	5	48	23	0.68
a large number	Written	91	19	9	49	23	0.67
can easily be	Written	92	0	0	32	15	0.67
with regard to	Written	93	9	4	85	40	0.66
there are several	Written	94	12	6	38	18	0.66

this paper we	Written	110	0	0	34	16	0.6
be seen as	Written	111	18	8	94	44	0.6
be related to the	Written	112	3	1	26	12	0.59
to ensure that	Written	113	11	5	94	44	0.59
it is important	Written	114	6	3	139	66	0.59
be explained by	Written	115	0	0	32	15	0.58
same way as	Written	116	11	5	32	15	0.58
see for example	Written	117	0	0	42	20	0.58
the presence of a	Written	118	3	1	50	24	0.58
that it is not	Written	119	7	3	37	17	0.58
in some cases	Written	120	40	19	68	32	0.58
to the fact that	Written	121	21	10	49	23	0.57
high levels of	Written	122	12	6	35	17	0.56
most likely to	Written	123	6	3	55	26	0.56
it appears that	Written	124	13	6	61	29	0.56
it follows that	Written	125	2	1	65	31	0.55
can also be	Written	126	13	6	111	52	0.55
it is clear	Written	127	6	3	83	39	0.54

it is impossible	Written	131	2	1	36	17	0.53
factors such as	Written	132	0	0	29	14	0.53
is consistent with	Written	133	1	0	61	29	0.53

none of these	Written	151	12	6	32	15	0.46
as shown in	Written	152	1	0	139	66	0.45

this means that	Written	154	13	6	77	36	0.45
be noted that	Written	155	0	0	45	21	0.45
